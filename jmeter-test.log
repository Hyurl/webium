This test only performs a response 'Hello, World!' on the same machine running
Windows 10.

I choose and show the best result from several tests of all these frameworks.
But multiple and more complicated conditions may produce different results.

Webium provides more detection in `res.send()` method and pre-calculated 
properties on `req` object, so when in simple cases, it may not perform as 
good as `koa`, but may act better in more complicated scenarios.
